# Future features

As the extension is still in development, there are many features that are planned to be added in the future. Here are some of them:

- [x] Custom templates: The extension will support custom templates, allowing users to create their own templates for any language.
- [ ] More languages: The extension may add support more languages in the future
- [ ] More templates: The extension will support more templates for each language in the future.
- [ ] Web Template: The extension will support web templates for HTML and commands templates for frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, etc.
- [x] File watcher: The extension will automatically activate the context menu when a file is created for selected languages (cs, py, ts, cpp), this will allow you to create files much faster, and easier.

> Note: The features listed above are not guaranteed to be added in the future, but they are a nice to have and will be added if possible. This is a side project, and I will work on it when I have time.
