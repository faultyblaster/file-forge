Create files from templates with a couple clicks or with commands!

The following programming languages are shipped by default:

- C#
- Python
- TypeScript
- Cpp
- Other (json, csv)

> **Note:** More templates will be added as the extension grows, if you want to contribute with a template, please, open a issue on the github [issue tab](https://github.com/faultyblaster/templator/issues) and we can discuss it, or you can create a pull request with the template you want to add.

## How to

Just right click on a folder on the explorer, select the template you want, and that's it, you can also run the command: `Create new file` or the shortcut `shift+alt+n` and select the template you want, and that's it!

### Automatic context menu activation

The extension will automatically activate the context menu when a file is created for selected languages (cs, py, ts, cpp), this will allow you to create files much faster, and easier.

## Requirements

No requirements to install, but the use of the extension for x languages assumes that x language is properly installed in the current system.

<!-- ## You can create your own templates

Simply add as many languages as you want
 -->
