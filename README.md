Create files from templates with a couple clicks or with commands!

The following programming languages are shipped by default:

- C#
- Python
- TypeScript
- Cpp
- Other (json, csv)

## Features

You can use the command palette or the context menu, as well as the shortcuts to create your files.

If you prefer to use the command palette, you can use the command `Create new file` or the shortcut `shift+alt+n` and select a language, and then select a template:

<!-- Show table with command / shortcut -->
| Command | Shortcut |
|------------------|------------------|
| Create new file | `shift+alt+n` |
| Create TypeScript file | `shift+alt+t` |
| Create C# file | `shift+alt+c` |
| Create Python file | `shift+alt+p` |
| Create Cpp file | `shift+alt+o` |

### TypeScript

Some of the available templates for typescript:

- Index file
- Class
- Interface

<!-- Show gif for py -->

Python templates:

- Main
- Requirements file
- Script

### Automatic context menu activation

The extension will automatically activate the context menu when a file is created for selected languages (cs, py, ts, cpp), this will allow you to create files much faster, and easier.

### Custom templates

Currently, the extension does not support custom templates, but it is planned to be added in the near future, so stay tuned!
