Create files from templates with a couple clicks or with commands!

The following programming languages are shipped by default:

- C#
- Python
- TypeScript
- Cpp
- Other (json, csv)

## Features

You can use the command palette or the context menu, as well as the shortcuts to create your files

- Here is an example of how the extension works, creating a file from a template for typescript:  

Some of the available templates for typescript:

- Index file
- Class
- Interface
- Enum
- Function
- Hello world `<= this one is on me, don't have to say thanks`

- Here is another example of how the extension works, creating a file from a template for C#:  
For C#, you can create files with the following templates:

- Class
- Interface
- Struct
- Enum

<!-- Show gif for py -->
![py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faultyblaster/file-forge/master/showcase/py.gif)

Python templates:

- Main
- Requirements file
- Script

> **Note:** More templates will be added as the extension grows, if you want to contribute with a template, please, open a issue on the github [issue tab](https://github.com/faultyblaster/templator/issues) and we can discuss it, or you can create a pull request with the template you want to add.

## How to

Just right click on a folder on the explorer, select the template you want, and that's it, you can also run the command: `Create new file` or the shortcut `shift+alt+n` and select the template you want, and that's it!

### Automatic context menu activation

The extension will automatically activate the context menu when a file is created for selected languages (cs, py, ts, cpp), this will allow you to create files much faster, and easier.

## Requirements

No requirements to install, but the use of the extension for x languages assumes that x language is properly installed in the current system.

<!-- ## You can create your own templates

Simply add as many languages as you want
 -->
